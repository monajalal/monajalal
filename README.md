- 👋 Hi, I’m @monajalal , proudly a former first-gen college student, and currently working as a Computer Vision Research Engineer III at Toyota Material Handling headquarter in Columbus, Indiana focusing on 3D Computer Vision using Deep Learning and Synthetic Data.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Vision and Deep Learning research and development and its cross-sections with robotics perception, computer graphics, and natural language understanding. Outside of work, I am interested in endurance road cycling, cooking, indoor rowing, and walking. Since 2015, I have moved to smart home technologies after spending 1 year as a research assistant at the Internet of Things lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I like to automate stuff in the house, on my bike, and on my computer(s). I was a PhD candidate in Computer Vision under supervision of Professors Margrit Betke and Vijaya Kolachalama 2017- 2022 focusing on vision and language for public communications and emerging media, human, animal, and object 2D and 3D pose, emotion recognition, human-object interaction, 3D object reconstruction, human mesh recovery, and WSI-based lung cancer recognition using deep learning. 
  
- I am looking forward to my first 10K run, first 100 mile road bike, and first 10,000 m indoor rowing, and first KONA Ironwoman. On a weekly basis, I do 1+ hr of Strength Training, 2+ hr of yoga (mainly vinyasa and yin), and at least 5+ miles of logged walk. In between, I try to do PT or road cycling depending on the weather. I strongly believe a healthy mind is inside a healthy brain and body and mind body health has a high priority in my daily life.

- I am currently learning more on BlenderProc and Omniverse Isaam Sim Python Coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 3D Pose Estimation and reconstruction (both dense and sparse)
- I am actively reviewing research conferences in 3D computer vision submitted to top computer vision conferences and journals. 
- I am looking forward to research talk opportunities as well as becoming a co-organizer for research workshops in computer vision and deep learning.
