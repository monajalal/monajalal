- 👋 Hi, I’m @monajalal
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Vision and Deep Learning research and its cross-sections with robotics perception, computer graphics, and natural language understanding. Outside of work, I am interested in endurance road cycling, cooking, and walking. I'm also a shopalcoholic and love online shopping. Since 2015, I have moved to smart home technologies after spending 1 year as a research assistant at the Internet of Things lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I like to automate stuff in the house, on my bike, and on my computer(s). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker, Azure MLOps, ROS, Azure DevOps, Bazel, ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 3D Pose Estimation and reconstruction (both dense and sparse)
- 📫 You can reach me via mona66jalal@gmail.com
