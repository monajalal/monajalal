- 👋 Hi, I’m @monajalal , proudly a former first-gen college student, and currently working as a Computer Vision Research Engineer III at Toyota Material Handling headquarter in Columbus, Indiana.
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Vision and Deep Learning research and development and its cross-sections with robotics perception, computer graphics, and natural language understanding. Outside of work, I am interested in endurance road cycling, cooking, indoor rowing, and walking. I'm also a shopalcoholic and love online shopping. Since 2015, I have moved to smart home technologies after spending 1 year as a research assistant at the Internet of Things lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I like to automate stuff in the house, on my bike, and on my computer(s). 
I am looking forward to my first 5K run, first 100 mile road bike, and first 10,000 m indoor rowing.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning and actively using Docker, Azure MLOps, ROS, Azure DevOps, Bazel, ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 3D Pose Estimation and reconstruction (both dense and sparse)
- I am actively reviewing research conferences in 3D computer vision submitted to top computer vision conferences and journals. 
- I am looking forward to research talk opportunities as well as becoming a co-organizer for research workshops in computer vision and deep learning. 
- 📫 You can reach me via mona66jalal@gmail.com or jalal@cs.wisc.edu
